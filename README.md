We will explore the use of C# and Excel to keep track of the pricing of various properties. We shall look to implement various useful statistical calculations which will allow you to gain further insight into the overall trends of the property market.

In this submission, below tasks are presented :

i)Set up the worksheet when the application is launched for the first time - The main method already calls a method “SetUp”; therefore, you simply have to implement this method, which should create a new Excel workbook titled “property_pricing.xlsx”

ii)Implement the adding of property information to the sheet - The property information headers are as follows:
a. Size (in square feet)
b. Suburb
c. City
d. Market value

iii)Implement statistical methods -. In the skeleton code you find the following four statistical methods already declared:
